# 🤖 AI Chatbot with Real-Time Sentiment Analysis

This project is an intelligent AI chatbot built with Python that can analyze and respond to user input based on detected sentiment. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to classify messages as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**, and generate appropriate, emotionally aware replies.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time sentiment analysis using **VADER** or **Naive Bayes**
- Interactive chatbot responses based on user emotion
- Text preprocessing: tokenization, TF-IDF vectorization, etc.
- GUI or web-based interface (Tkinter or Streamlit)
- Custom model training with labeled datasets (optional)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, NLTK, VADER, TextBlob
- Scikit-learn (Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression)
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Flask / Tkinter / Streamlit (for user interface)

## 🧪 How It Works
1. User enters a message into the chatbot interface.
2. The message is processed and analyzed for sentiment.
3. Sentiment is classified (Positive, Negative, or Neutral).
4. Chatbot generates an appropriate response based on the sentiment.

## 💡 Use Cases
- Customer service bots
- Mental health assistants
- Social media and review sentiment monitoring
- Feedback analysis systems

🎯 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Natural Language Processing and sentiment analysis can be integrated to create emotionally intelligent conversational agents. The chatbot’s ability to interpret user sentiment and respond accordingly provides a foundation for developing more advanced, context-aware AI assistants in the future.
With enhancements such as contextual memory, voice integration, and deep learning–based embeddings, this project can evolve into a full-fledged, real-time intelligent chatbot capable of understanding and empathizing with users.
